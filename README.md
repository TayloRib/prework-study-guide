# HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript Study Guide
A study guide for the basics of web development

The purpose of this project was to use my newfound knowledge of web development to create a location for my working notes. The website was built in order to showcase the talents I learned with HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. It is a convenient way to store notes in an easy to access location, which I can share with others. It allowed me to learn the basic processes of web development, using new languages in tandem to code, debug, and publish my first web page.
